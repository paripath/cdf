# CDF
**Characterization Description Format**

CDF or characterization description format is effective in capturing properties of VLSI cells and IPS at several levels of abstraction.
It is a baseline proposal for a standard to act as an interface across VLSI software(s) using and/or interfacting with 
[SPICE simulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE).

It is currently being used characterization software for cells, memories, and IPs.
